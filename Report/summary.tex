In the field of numerical analysis and scientific computation, partial differential equations are commonly solved by stacking the unknowns of a problem into a single vector. This ignores underlying structures, which can come at a significant cost when the problem contains elements of uncertainty. This project explores the matrix formulation of partial differential equations that arise from Poisson's equation and demonstrates how one can take advantage of a problem's structure when dealing with this formulation. It then investigates the effect uncertainty has when introduced into the problem and explores methods to solve this problem.
