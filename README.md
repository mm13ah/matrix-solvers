# Matrix Solvers for Stochastic Galerkin Schemes
2017/18 Master's Thesis, University of Leeds

A study and implementation of various methods for solving matrix equations that arise from Poisson's equation and how these methods can be applied to random PDEs (PDEs with uncertain input).

Algorithms studied include:
- Kronecker Product
- Bartels-Stewart Algorithm
- Similarity Transformation
- Shifted System
- Gradient Based Method
- Modified Conjugate Gradient
- Preconditioned MCG
- Shifted System

Also studies the Monte Carlo and stochastic Galerkin method for solving random PDEs.
The code requires the installation of the Numpy and SciPy libraries, as well as Jupyter (can all be installed
via Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/ ).
