I would sincerely like to thank my project supervisor, Thomas Ranner, for his invaluable guidance and support during this project. His encouragement and feedback throughout has made it a thoroughly rewarding experience. I would also like to thank the University of Leeds and the School of Computing, as well as all the lecturers who have taught me throughout this year, as I have thoroughly enjoyed studying my MSc.
